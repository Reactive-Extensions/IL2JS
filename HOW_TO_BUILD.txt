Prerequisites:
 - VS2010
 - Silverlight V4 Runtime and SDK
 - PowerShell V2

1. Start shell.bat, locatated in the root of the distribution.

2. From within that shell, type:
     .\setup
   to construct some of the project files.

3. Then type:
     .\build
   to build the compiler, rewriter and support libraries.

4. (Optional) To run the baseline tests, try:
     .\test run

5. IL2JS_CompileTime.sln referenences all the compile-time projects (compiler and support libraries).
   IL2JS_RunTime.sln references all the run-time projects (run-time libraries and tests).
   These solutions, and all the projects they reference, require the environment variable:
     IL2JSROOT
   or the registery setting
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IL2JS@Root
   to be set to <your path to IL2JS>. The powershell setup above sets this variable for you. If you wish
   to use the solutions or projects elsewhere, please set this variable yourself.

6. Type:
     .\clean
   to clean all built files, and:
     .\teardown
   to delete all constructed project files.
